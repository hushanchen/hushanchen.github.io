Today I trying to modiy some config file .exe.conf in win7,
met saving error,
then I tried to check the permission, it's ok, below step refer to:
1. right click file, select Properties
2. if not Read-only, then click Security tag
3. select your user name, then click Edit button
4. tick Allow or Deny chekbox
5. Apply and OK

for windows system, change file permission, especially for config file when you have administrtive access.
